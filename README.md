## Waste Classification using Deep Learning in CNN

### Project Overview
Waste Classification using Deep Learning is a computer vision project that aims to automate the process of waste sorting and classification. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify waste items into two primary categories: "Organic" and "Recyclable." With the growing concern for environmental sustainability, this project contributes to waste management efforts by efficiently segregating waste materials.

### Key Features
- **Deep Learning Model**: The project employs a state-of-the-art deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks. These neural networks are known for their effectiveness in image classification tasks.

- **Large Dataset**: The model is trained on a substantial dataset consisting of 25,000 images, with equal representation of both "Organic" and "Recyclable" waste items. This extensive dataset enables the model to make accurate predictions.

- **Data Augmentation**: To enhance model generalization, data augmentation techniques such as image rotation, flipping, and zooming are applied during the training phase.

- **Model Evaluation**: The project evaluates the model's performance on both a validation set and a test set, employing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

- **Transfer Learning**: Transfer learning is used to leverage pre-trained neural network architectures and fine-tune them for the specific waste classification task. This approach accelerates training and improves accuracy.

- **Model Interpretability**: The project includes tools to interpret and visualize the model's predictions, shedding light on the features that influence classification decisions.

- **GitHub Repository**: The project is hosted on GitHub, providing open access to the source code, documentation, and resources. This fosters collaboration and allows others to contribute to the project's development.
